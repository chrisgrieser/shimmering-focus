- Setting to define a mobile-specific font size
- To save precious mobile space, the header is replaced with a floating button that toggles between Reading and Editing Mode.
- If you prefer to have a header, you can use the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) to re-enable it.
