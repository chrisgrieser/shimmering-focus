## Key Features
- __Radical Minimalism:__ UI elements that require the mouse are still accessible on hover. All hidden UI elements can be permanently re-enabled with the [Style Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).
- __Condensed Display of Information:__ Unnecessary padding and white-space is removed, which is beneficial for small screens or higher zoom levels.
- __High Customizability:__ Dozens of customization options available via [Style Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).
- __Native macOS Look:__ Options for native macOS look using the [Style Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

## More Features
- Language, Wrapping, and Line Numbering in Code Blocks.
- Extensive Styling for the [Longform Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform), including alternative background color and serif-fonts for notes in longform projects.
- Annotation Tags: Tags that are emphasized when used inline (not in the YAML Frontmatter). They are meant as visual guides for reading and literature notes. They include: `#definition`, `#question`, `#goal`, `#todo`, `#summary`, `#important`, `#main`, `#critique`, `#gap`, `#litreview`, `#quote`, `#agree`, `#disagree`, `#example`, `#data`, `#method`, `#idea`, and `#sidenote`.
- The only theme (I am aware of) where Vim Mode has been explicitly styled.

## CSS Classes
- `full-width`: Disables "Readable Line Length" for the note.
- `writing`: Uses writing-related styling like serif fonts in the note.
- `bibliography-list`: Displays lists in the style of academic bibliographies (Reading Mode).
- `list-2-col-cards`: Turns list items into cards (Reading Mode).
- `remove-dataview-title`: Removes the header from Dataview results.

## Recommended Plugins
- [Style Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings): Unlocks dozens of customization options.
- [Supercharged Links](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=supercharged-links-obsidian): The theme includes various built-in styling for the Supercharged Links plugin, e.g. appending a "ðŸŒ±" to notes with the `#seedling` tag.
- for macOS: [Electron Window Tweaker](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-electron-window-tweaker): Position the traffic lights for even more native macOS look. (Same position as in Safari: X = 20, Y = 18.)
- While using the theme, you can disable the Hider Plugin, since *Shimmering Focus* already hides everything it does hide.

## Obsidian 0.16
*Due to Obsidian update 0.16, I had to start a full rewrite of the theme. Since the theme has more than 15,000 lines of CSS, it will unfortunately take quite a bit of time until all previous features are restored. The documentation, to, will be rewritten.*

__Technical Roadmap for 0.16__
- [ ] new Promo Screenshot (16:9, 512 x 288 px)
- [ ] ðŸŽ¯ PR to `obsidian-releases`, removing `legacy` label and updating screenshot link.
