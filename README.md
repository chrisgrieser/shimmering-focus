## Features

### Hiding/Showing UI Elements
- By default, many UI elements are hidden, directing your focus to what matters ‚Äì your notes.
- You can re-enable individual hidden UI elements by using the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/).
- The status bar, header bar, graph controls, resize handles, and collapse arrows but become visible upon hovering or being active.
- Obsidian 0.13+: in Source Mode, URLs on non-active lines are folded.

üí° The YAML frontmatter in Preview Mode is not removed by this theme, since you can already disable it with the native Obsidian settings under `Settings ‚ûû Editor ‚ûû Show Frontmatter`.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73286100/131692972-e523f2d4-40c7-452c-83ac-a7f2fbd546ae.gif" alt="headerbar visible on hover" width=50%>

### Annotation Tags
Type one of the following eight tags (e.g. `#definition`) to get a colored annotation tag. Also works in Edit Mode. Intended for Annotations when reading academic papers.

<img width=25% alt="Annotation Tags" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73286100/146721469-c453a9ed-0e28-4923-a171-f1e196c2e6e1.png">

üí° You can add your own Annotation Tags by adding a snippet [using this template](CSS%20Snippets/annotation-tag-template.css).

### Max View & Focus View
- __Max View__ *(disabled by default)*: When the *left* sidebar is hidden, line length is extended to full length, and images & PDFs are expanded to full width. Readable line length and smaller image & PDF size are re-applied when the left sidebar is shown again.[^1] This is useful when dealing with big tables or many images. To enable *Max View* or adjust the size of images & PDFs, use the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/).
- __Focus View__ *(disabled by default)*: Hiding the *left* side bar will also hide the *right* sidebar, with the right side bar staying hidden until the left one is shown again. This synergizes with *Max View*, but also works independently. To enable *Focus View*, use the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/).

üí°  For both features, it is useful to set a hotkey for the built-in command `Toggle left sidebar`.

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73286100/138562271-2f7d3589-d580-49e4-bea6-ca3e3004ab78.gif" alt="Promo Max View" width=60%>

### Image-related Features
- Click & hold an image to zoom (Preview Mode).
- Alt-text is automatically used as image caption (Preview Mode).
- Set a default image size with the Style Settings Plugin.
- You can also use [Max View](#max-view--focus-view) to toggle between reduced and full image sizes.

### Multi-Color-Highlighting & Spoiler Syntax
- Surround highlights with `*` or `**` for alternative highlight colors (`*==cyan==*` and `**==yellow==**`).
- You can use the [Extra Markdown Commands Plugin](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-extra-md-commands) to get hotkeys for them.
- Spoiler Syntax: Emphasized Strikethroughs (`*~~spoiler~~*`) will selectively hide text, except when hovered or the active line.

### CSS Classes
Add `cssclass: {name}` to your yaml front matter to activate specific styling of the note in Preview Mode. The following CSS classes are built in with this theme (more coming in the future):
- `cssclass: clean-top`: Removes Metadata Information, YAML frontmatter, and Breadcrumbs trail from the top of the note.
- `cssclass: clean-embeds`: Embeds in that note are fully embedded, looking like one document.
- `cssclass: dataview-list-in-table`: If you are using a dataview query where some table cells contain lists, use this CSS class to remove the vertical table lines that are off.

### Focus Line Highlight
![Focused Line Highlight](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73286100/147863593-a50fbeb0-04c2-4faf-8253-62abf8efca2d.gif)

In contrast to typical active line highlights, the *focused* line highlight will only highlight the direct line where the cursor is located. However, this feature disables the ability to scroll horizontally, so it is disabled by default and must be enabled in the Style Settings. 

### Gutter Indicators
To help increase scannability of long notes, some the presence of some easy-to-miss elements are indicated in the gutter. All indicators can be turned off with the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/).
- Footnotes (all modes)
- Search Result Matches (only Source Mode & Live Preview)
- Unresolved links (only Preview Mode)

### CSS-only Multi-line Admonitions
Using triple-blockquotes (`>>>`) will create CSS only admonitions which work in all three modes.
<img width=60% alt="pseudo admonitions" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73286100/148685616-d0447649-82f3-4854-b59c-159ec2d172b0.gif">

### Built-in Styling for Supercharged Links
This theme includes built-in styling for the [Supercharged Links Plugin](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links). This means you can make use of the plugin's features without the need write your own CSS! (If you already have your own Supercharged Links setup, you can turn those of with the Style Settings Plugin.) For now the theme includes the following styling:
- Links to _Kanban Boards_ get "üéÜ" prepended
- Links to notes with the tag `#seedling` get "üå±" prepended
- Notes with `#evergreen` get "üå≤" prepended
- Notes with `#moc` get "üó∫" prepended
- Notes with `#person` get "üë§" prepended
- Notes with `#checklist` get "‚òëÔ∏è" prepended
- Links to _Literature Notes_ get a tooltip with the content of the `title` yaml key when hovering and get "üìñ" prepended. (Actually, this applies to any note with a `title` yaml frontmatter key.)
- Breadcrumbs users: Links to notes with the `up` yaml key get a tooltip with the content of that yaml key, and get "ü•ñ" prepended.

<img width=60% alt="Demo tooltips" src="https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/e25082da1bfe16d54e36618cd5bfee68/00%20-%20Contribute%20to%20the%20Obsidian%20Hub/02%20Attachments/Tooltips-for-Literature-Notes-with-Supercharged-Links.gif">

**Setup**
- Install [the plugin](https://github.com/mdelobelle/obsidian_supercharged_links).
- Make sure you have `Parse all tags in the file` enabled in the plugin's settings.
- If you are using the "Page Preview" Core Plugin, configure it to not display previews for the cases where you want the tooltips to show up.
- Paste the following field in the text field `Target Attributes for styling`:

```text
kanban-plugin, title, up
```

### Academic Work
- Extensive Styling and settings specifically for the [Longform Plugin](https://github.com/kevboh/longform). Prepend a `_` to file names of longform scenes to create sub-scenes that are indented in the sidebar.
- [Pandoc Citations](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#citations-in-note-styles) (`[@citekey]`) and footnotes are visually emphasized.
- Footnotes get [separate indicators in the gutter](#gutter-indicators).
- The [built-in styling for Supercharged Links](#built-in-styling-for-supercharged-links) includes tooltips showing the literature note for popups.
- The alt-text of images is used as caption text, in line with Pandoc's conversion behavior
- The [Max View](#max-view--focus-view) is useful for displaying wide markdown tables.
- [Multi-Color-Highlighting](#multi-color-highlighting--spoiler-syntax) and [Annotation Tags](#annotation-tags) have specifically been made for academic reading.
- Indicates trailing white spaces when there is more than one space. This is useful for the Markdown [Two Space Rule](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#p). 

### Further Features
- Relationship lines in various side bar tabs
- File explorer icons
- Customizable Brightness of the Theme
- Dark Mode for PDFs (when using the theme in dark mode)

## Design Principles

### Extreme Minimalism
- This theme is mainly intended for experienced users using mainly the keyboard for navigation.
- As much clutter as possible is removed, letting you focus on content & information that matters.
- You can re-enable all hidden elements by using the [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/).
- üí° The settings can still be accessed via `cmd + ,` or `ctrl + ,`.

### Condensed Display of Information
- Screen real estate is used much more efficiently to display more information at the same time.
- Useful for smaller screens, split screens, bigger font sizes, or simply to see more information without having to scroll.
- Images and PDFs are displayed at a smaller sized. (Size can be configured with the Style Settings Plugin,) Click and hold an image to enlarge it again, or use the [Max View Feature](#Max-View).
- Option to trim filenames in the sidebar for even more compactness.

### High Readability
- Theme Brightness is adjustable via [Style Settings Plugin](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings/).
- [Gutter Indicators](#gutter-indicators) and the visual emphasis of Pandoc Citations and footnotes increase the scannability of longer notes.
- Wider Input boxes, clearer icons, increased size of small UI elements (e.g. collapse indicators), thicker lines for tables & hr.
- Increased contrast throughout, especially with the [annoying gray font on light-gray background](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/enhance-default-color-contrast-of-the-icons/23045/3).
- Decreased font size variation to increase readability & information density
- At the same time increased distinctiveness of different classes through subtle variation in typeface, font style, or backgrounds.
- Alternating row colors in tables, Command Palette, and Quick Switchers, ...
- Increased readability of bold in dark mode by applying subtle text shadow.
- Plugin names in the Command Palette are moved to the right and more visually distinct.
- Overscroll at the bottom of the editor and settings tabs.
- Easy-to-read fonts for every use case:
	- [iA Writer Quattro](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/tree/master/iA%20Writer%20Quattro) as clear sans font for the editor
	- [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) for as a clear UI font
	- [Input Mono](https://input.djr.com/) as monospace font for code
	- [Optima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima) as humanist font for headings
	- [Crimson Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Crimson+Pro) as serif font for Longform notes

## Contribute to the Theme

### Contribute CSS Snippets
The following types of CSS snippets are self-contained and relatively easy to contribute:
- [CSS Classes](#css-classes), e.g. for tables.
- More built-in styling for the [Supercharged Links Plugin](#built-in-styling-for-supercharged-links).
- Support or fixes for [plugins that are not supported yet](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Themes/Shimmering+Focus#Plugin+Compatibility+1).

- Color Schemes which can be selected via Style Settings. Simply use the following template. (Note that these will change, once I added options to customize other colors like accent colors.)

```css
/* template for adding a preset color scheme to Shimmering Focus */
.theme-dark.theme-dark,
.theme-light.theme-light {
	--light-hue: 220;
	--dark-hue: 0;
	--dark-sat: 0%;
	--light-sat: 0%;
	--brightness-light: 15%;
	--brightness-dark: 5%;
}
```
