## ‚ö†Ô∏è Obsidian 0.16

Due to Obsidian update 0.16, I had to start a full rewrite of the theme. Since the theme has more than 15,000 lines of CSS, this will naturally take quite a bit of time.

## Roadmap for 0.16

- [x] update build script
- [x] update issue templates
- [x] create `manifest.json`
- [ ] new Promo Screenshot (16:9, 512x288px)
- [ ] new README for theme Gallery
- [ ] ‚ùáÔ∏è PR to `obsidian-releases`, removing `legacy` label and updating screenshot link.

### Feature Wise
- [ ] Base Features (mostly hiding of UI elements)
- [ ] üü™ Gamma Color Scheme
- [ ] Style Settings
- [ ] Plugin Support
