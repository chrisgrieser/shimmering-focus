## Design philosophy
- __Radical minimalism:__ As opposed to a minimalism of *colors*, this theme
  focuses on a minimalistic *user interface*: UI elements not relevant for
  keyboard users are hidden, or only shown when needed. All hidden UI elements
  can be permanently re-enabled with the [Style Settings
  Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).
- __Condensed display of information:__ Unnecessary padding and white-space is
  removed, which is beneficial for small screens or higher zoom levels.
- __High customizability:__ Dozens of customization options available via the
  [Style Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

## Features
- __Smart hiding of UI elements__: The tab bar is only shown when there is more
  than one tab open, and the sidebar tab buttons are only shown on hover.
- __Images__: Alt-text of images used as __caption__, images can be zoomed in
  via click-and-hold or toggled between reduced and original size via Style
  Settings.
- __Tables__: Highlighting of active cells, alternating row colors
- __Vim mode__: Explicit styling of Obsidian's Vim Mode and various
  settings such as relative line numbers.
- __Writing__: Emphasis of __Pandoc citations__ and __footnotes__, extensive
  styling for the [Longform Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform).
- __Headings__: Distinctive styling and various options for differentiating
  heading levels.
- __Many customization options__ available via [Style
  Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

## Commands
When the [Style Settings
Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings) is installed,
*Shimmering Focus* adds commands for toggling theme features:
- Toggle folding of URLs (Source Mode)
- Toggle between reduced and original image size (reduced size can be set in the
  respective style setting)

## Customize colors
With *Shimmering Focus*, you can create your own color scheme with this CSS
snippet. You are welcome to [share your color
scheme](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus/discussions/new?category=share-your-custom-color-schemes).

```css
.theme-light.theme-light {
    --bg-hue: 230;
    --bg-sat: 25%;

    /* `--color-accent-hsl` should have the same values as `--color-accent` */
    --color-accent: hsl(184 79% 35%);
    --color-accent-hsl: 184, 79%, 35%;
    --interactive-accent: hsl(184 79% 30%);

    --alt-heading-color: hsl(232 34% 50%);
    --secondary-accent: hsl(28 54% 51%);
    --hover-accent: hsl(328 100% 54%);
    --link-unresolved-color: hsl(101 42% 51%);
}

.theme-dark.theme-dark {
    --bg-hue: 230;
    --bg-sat: 15%;

    /* Note that `--color-accent-hsl` should have the same values as `--color-accent` */
    --color-accent: hsl(184 79% 45%);
    --color-accent-hsl: 184, 79%, 35%;
    --interactive-accent: hsl(184 79% 30%);

    --alt-heading-color: hsl(232 50% 70%);
    --secondary-accent: hsl(28 63% 61%);
    --hover-accent: hsl(328 100% 64%);
	--link-unresolved-color: hsl(101 42% 51%);
}

/* Hide the background color settings since they are overwritten by the custom colors above */ 
.style-settings-container .setting-item:is([data-id="bg-hue-light"],[data-id="bg-hue-dark"]) {
	display: none;
}
```

## Standalone snippets
Some features of this theme are available as standalone snippets. These can be
found in the [snippets directory](./snippets).

<!-- vale Google.Will = NO -->
## Contribute
Bug fixes, support for more plugins, or improvements for mobile are welcome.
However, please ask before contributing entirely new features by creating a
Draft PR or an issue.

All relevant source files are located in the [source](./source) directory, and
will be compiled via GitHub action when pushed to GitHub.

The theme uses `lightning-css` for
[syntax-lowering](https://lightningcss.dev/transpilation.html#syntax-lowering)
in its build. That means you can use modern CSS features like
[CSS-nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting), as
the resulting `theme.css` will still be compatible with older Obsidian Installer
versions that do not support nesting yet. Furthermore, this theme targets
Obsidian installer version 1.1.9, so feel free to use `:has()`.

The theme is written completely dependency-free in vanilla CSS.
