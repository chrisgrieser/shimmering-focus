## Design philosophy
- __Radical minimalism:__ As opposed to a minimalism of *colors*, this theme
  focuses on a minimalistic *user interface*: Buttons and sidebars not relevant
  for keyboard users are removed. UI elements that require the mouse are still
  accessible on hover. (All hidden UI elements can be permanently re-enabled
  with the [Style Settings
  Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).)
- __Condensed Display of Information:__ Unnecessary padding and white-space is
  removed, which is beneficial for small screens or higher zoom levels.
- __High Customizability:__ Dozens of customization options available via the
  [Style Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

## Features
- __Images__: Alt-text of images used as __caption__, images can be zoomed in
  via click-and-hold or toggled between reduced and original size via Style
  Settings.
- __Tables__: Highlighting of active cells, alternating row colors
- __Vim mode__: Explicit styling of Obsidian's Vim Mode and various
  settings such as relative line numbers.
- __Writing__: Emphasis of __Pandoc citations__ and __footnotes__, extensive
  styling for the [Longform Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform).
- __Headings__: Distinctive styling and various options for differentiating
  heading levels.
- __Many customization options__ available via [Style
  Settings Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).
