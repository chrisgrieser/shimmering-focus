## General information

### Design philosophy
- **Radical minimalism:** As opposed to a minimalism of *colors*, this theme
  focuses on a minimalistic *user interface*: UI elements not relevant for
  keyboard users are hidden, or only shown when needed. All hidden UI elements
  can be permanently re-enabled with the [Style Settings
  Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).
- **Condensed display of information:** Unnecessary padding and white-space is
  removed, which is beneficial for small screens or higher zoom levels.
- **High customizability:** Over a hundred customization options available
  via the [Style Settings
  Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

### Features
- **Smart hiding of UI elements**: The tab bar is only shown when there is more
  than one tab open, and the sidebar tab buttons are only shown on hover.
- **Images**: Alt-text of images used as **caption**, images can be zoomed in
  via click-and-hold or toggled between reduced and original size via Style
  Settings.
- **Headings**: Distinctive styling and various options for differentiating
  heading levels.
- **Tables**: Highlighting of active cells, alternating row colors
- **Alternative color schemes** submitted by the community are available by
  using the Style Settings Plugin.
- **For writers**: Emphasis of **Pandoc citations** and **footnotes**, extensive
  styling for the [Longform Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=longform).
- **For vim users**: Explicit styling of Obsidian's Vim Mode, including various
  settings such as relative line numbers or cursorline highlights.
- **High customizability:** There are over a hundred customization options
  available via the [Style Settings
  Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

### Commands
When the [Style Settings
Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings) is installed,
*Shimmering Focus* adds commands for toggling theme features:
- Toggle folding of URLs (Source Mode)
- Toggle between reduced and original image size (reduced size can be set in the
  respective style setting)
- Toggle readable line length (requires the `Readable line length` setting in
  Obsidian to be enabled.)

### Settings for writers
- Add `cssclasses: writing` to your frontmatter to enable writing-specific
  styling for that note, such as a serif font and justified text. The same
  styling is also applied to all scenes from the [longform plugin](http://github.com/kevboh/longform).
- You can customize the styling with the [Style Settings
  Plugin](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=obsidian-style-settings).

## Advanced customization

### Create your own color scheme
With *Shimmering Focus*, you can create your own color scheme with this CSS
snippet.

```css
.theme-light.theme-light {
    --bg-hue: 230;
    --bg-sat: 25%;

    /* `--color-accent-hsl` should have the same values as `--color-accent` */
    --color-accent: hsl(184 79% 35%);
    --color-accent-hsl: 184, 79%, 35%;
    --interactive-accent: hsl(184 79% 30%);

    --alt-heading-color: hsl(232 34% 50%);
    --secondary-accent: hsl(28 54% 51%);
    --hover-accent: hsl(328 100% 54%);
    --link-unresolved-color: hsl(101 42% 51%);
}

.theme-dark.theme-dark {
    --bg-hue: 230;
    --bg-sat: 15%;

    /* Note that `--color-accent-hsl` should have the same values as `--color-accent` */
    --color-accent: hsl(184 79% 45%);
    --color-accent-hsl: 184, 79%, 35%;
    --interactive-accent: hsl(184 79% 30%);

    --alt-heading-color: hsl(232 50% 70%);
    --secondary-accent: hsl(28 63% 61%);
    --hover-accent: hsl(328 100% 64%);
	--link-unresolved-color: hsl(101 42% 51%);
}
```

You can [suggest your color scheme for inclusion in Shimmering
Focus](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-focus/discussions/categories/suggest-your-color-scheme-for-inclusion-in-shimmering-focus).
Especially submissions of classic, well-known color schemes are welcome.

### Standalone snippets
Some features of this theme are available as standalone snippets. These can be
found in the [snippets directory](./snippets).

### Contribute to the theme
Bug fixes, support for more plugins, or improvements for mobile are welcome.
However, please ask before contributing entirely new features by creating a
Draft PR or an issue.

All relevant source files are located in the [source](./source) directory, and
will be compiled via GitHub action when pushed to GitHub.

The theme uses `lightning-css` for
[syntax-lowering](https://lightningcss.dev/transpilation.html#syntax-lowering)
in its build. That means you can use modern CSS features like
[CSS-nesting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting),
as the resulting `theme.css` will still be compatible with older Obsidian
installer versions. Furthermore, this theme targets Obsidian installer version
1.1.9, so you can use `:has()`.

The theme is written completely dependency-free in vanilla CSS.
